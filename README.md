# MoCafe ‚òï

> A 3D cafe simulator game built with Godot Engine using GDScript  
> Work in Progress (WIP)

## About the Game

**MoCafe** is a cafe simulator game where you can brew various types of coffee such as:
- Americano  
- Long Black  
- Cappuccino
- Double Shot Drinks

The game focuses on replicating the experience of operating a cafe‚Äôs coffee-making station, including handling ingredients and preparing drinks. While the game currently does not include customer interaction or objectives, those features may be added in future updates.

## What I Learned

This project was part of my learning journey with the Godot Engine and GDScript. Through building MoCafe, I:
- Learned how to develop a game using a professional game engine.
- Applied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts learned in university.
- Practiced using **SOLID principles** to organize and structure game logic and systems.
